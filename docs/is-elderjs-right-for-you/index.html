<div class="title svelte-1sp2bm8"><h1 class="svelte-1sp2bm8">Is Elder.js Right For You?</h1>
  <small>By Nick Reese</small></div>

<!-- HTML_TAG_START --><p>Elder.js was built as a static site generator (SSG) but was developed into a full server side rendering (SSR) framework.</p>
<p>If you're wondering if Elder.js will support your use case we have 1 good rule to help you make that decision:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Are you looking to build a <strong>"modern" app with client side routing</strong>? If so, Elder.js <strong>IS NOT</strong> the right solution for you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We like to think that Elder.js is great a building <strong>websites</strong>, regardless of whether they are statically generated or server rendered.</p>
<p>If you're building an "App" you can definitely use Elder.js but if you want client side routing make sure to check out <a href="https://kit.svelte.dev/">SvelteKit</a>.</p>
<h2 id="common-use-cases-for-elderjs">Common Use Cases for Elder.js</h2>
<p>The Elder.js project was born out of the system that powers <a href="https://elderguide.com/">ElderGuide.com</a>. When building Elder Guide we searched high and low for a blazing fast static site generator that we could use with Svelte, but couldn't find anything that fit our needs.</p>
<p>After 6 months of building a great system, we decided to polish it a bit more and open it up into a project others could use.</p>
<p>Today, Elder.js has two main functions: one as a static site generator and the other as <code>express</code> middleware where it acts as a Svelte framework that supports server side rendering (SSR) and partial hydration. (You're probably viewing this page on the <code>express</code> middleware version.)</p>
<p>All of this said, we highly recommend Elder.js as a tool for building statically generated sites that can be cheaply and securely hosted on S3, Netlify, or Cloudflare.</p>
<p>These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Flagship SEO websites with 10,000s of pages</li>
<li>Blogs and personal websites</li>
<li>Portfolio or brochure websites</li>
</ul>
<p>To see static export in action run <code>npm run build</code> in your terminal. We think you'll be surprised how fast it builds. :)</p>
<p>If you are looking to use Elder.js as an <code>express</code> middleware make sure to look at the <a href="/middleware/"><code>middleware</code></a> hook as it should empower you to do anything you'd need to do with Express.</p>
<h2 id="learning-curves">Learning Curves</h2>
<p>Like most frameworks Elder.js has a learning curve but we've tried to keep it as minimal as possible to achieve common customizations while still making use of advanced Elder.js features as approachable as possible.</p>
<p>The largest learning curve for most people is learning how to use <code>hooks</code> and <code>shortcodes</code> to achieve their goals.</p>
<p>If you are able to understand the routes found in this template then you shouldn't have too many issues.</p>
<h2 id="elderjs-vs-sveltekit">Elder.js vs SvelteKit</h2>
<p>How Elder compares to SvelteKit is a very common question. The key distinction is that Elder.js is designed with SEO in mind and offers tools to help make building large static sites easier.</p>
<ol>
<li>Partial Hydration: Most <strong>"modern javascript frameworks"</strong> use client side routing which requires complete rehydration of the client. This can cause major SEO issues as <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/javascript-seo-basics">Google Bot's process for indexing javascript heavy websites</a> differs from that of mainly static sites. This is why many javascript sites that use <code>react</code>, <code>vue</code>, <code>angular</code> and <code>svelte</code> struggle with SEO even if they are server side rendered (SSR). In our experience partial hydration results in less indexation issues for Google much like <code>jquery</code> sites of yester-year. This is why Elder.js has gone all-in on partial hydration. We believe it is a competitive SEO advantage. (<a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2019/02/rendering-on-the-web">Google has a great guide on hydration</a>.)</li>
<li>Data Flow: When it comes to building non-trivial static sites, there is a lot of data massaging that needs to be in sync across the entire project. A good example is when reading from a headless CMS or generating a sitemap. With Elder.js, you can organize this data once and add it where you need to via a hook and it will be available on all pages. This is what enables Elder's extreme build speed, whereas SvelteKit has no data pipeline opinion.</li>
<li>Elder.js has <code>shortcodes</code> which allow you to future proof your content.</li>
<li>Elder.js uses <code>hooks</code> allowing your team to encapsulate much of a site's complexity in one place. These hooks also empower a growing ecosystem of plugins.</li>
<li>Complete control over routing and url structure. SvelteKit uses file based routing which has it's benefits and limitations.</li>
</ol>
<p>In short, Elder.js is purpose built to run flagship SEO sites with 10-100k pages.</p>
<p>SvelteKit is not out of beta but <a href="https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/1390">currently does not</a> support Partial Hydration - you have to opt in/out of JS on a per-page basis, instead of per-component.</p>
<p>SvelteKit uses Vite and HMR which result in a bit better developer experience.</p>
<h2 id="what-parts-of-elderjs-arent-perfect-yet">What Parts of Elder.js Aren't Perfect Yet?</h2>
<p><strong>A Very Complex Rollup Config</strong></p>
<p>To be candid, Elder.js's biggest drawback is it's very complex Rollup configuration that is internalized into Elder.js which makes it hard to edit for custom needs.</p>
<p>As of v1.5, you can also use <code>npm run esbuild</code> to use the esbuild bundler which is much faster.</p>
<p><strong>A Very Strict Folder Structure</strong></p>
<p>Because of Elder.js' complex Rollup config it needs to follow a pretty specific file structure. This project matches that file structure and you can learn more about it on the <a href="/getting-started/">getting started</a> page.</p>
<p><strong>No Live Reload / HMR support (Yet)</strong></p>
<p>We realize developer experience is crucial and see potential in using <code>esbuild</code> to speed up our local development environment. While we'd love to use <code>snowpack</code> or <code>vite</code> due to our complex client and SSR bundling needs we need something with a bit more control.</p>
